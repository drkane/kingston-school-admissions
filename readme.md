# About the map

This map is designed to help with the process of applying for places in reception classes at primary schools in Kingston upon Thames.

The main purpose is to display all the primary schools on one map, and then to show the distance to the furthest away pupil offered a place at reception on the basis of distance from the school in the latest year available.

The data on schools and their admissions criteria can be found on the Kingston council website. All the data has been extracted from the booklet [**Admission to Kingston's Primary Schools 2017**](https://www.kingston.gov.uk/downloads/download/217/primary_school_admissions_brochure).

There are lots of caveats to this data - but the main one is that it should only be used as a guide to help with the process as described in the booklet. Other things to remember are:

- The distance to the furthest away pupil is not always available for every school. Some schools filled up places before the distance criteria was used and some don't show it in the booklet for some reason.
- The map placements are not exact and so may be different to the calculation that Kingston Council do when calculating distance. Schools are placed using postcodes converted to latitude and longitude, so may not be in exactly the right place. The distance circles are calculated by converting the distance given in the booklet to meters and then drawing a circle of that radius around the school.
- There are a range of different entrance criteria for all the schools in Kingston, and distance from the school is often only one of many criteria. There may be children at the school who are further away that entered under other criteria.
- The distance changes from year to year - generally the 2016 distance is used, but if it is not known then the latest year is used.

Good luck School hunting!
